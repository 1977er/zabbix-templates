This template and script (which uses NetCat) will perform a check to see if a TCP port is responding on a monitored host.
You could easily use the build in net.tcp.service item for this, but I ran into the problem that I needed to be able and specify the source IP from a Zabbix proxy with secondary IP addresses.

The {$SOURCE} macro should be set to the appropriate source IP address of the Zabbix server or proxy.
To specify the port to be checked, adjust the {$PORT} macro accordingly on the template or host level.
If more than 1 port check or source is needed for a host, you can of course hard code items with the proper port and address combination.

The template is setup as an external check in Zabbix (place the script in the appropriate directory)
but it could easily be adjusted to a UserParameter for the Zabbix Agent if needed.
