LLD template for Microsoft Windows Services

For this template to work, a userparameter must be added to the agent configuration.
For example, if the servdisc.ps1 is residing in C:\, the userparameter would look like this:

UserParameter=service.discovery,powershell -File c:\servdisc.ps1

Also note that on my test system, it took a while before powershell would return results.
This caused timeouts in the agent which resulted in "not supported errors" for the discovery item.
To solve this, I upped the timout in the agent to 10 seconds:

Timeout=10

By default the actual template will do a discovery of all the services that should automatically be started and that are currently in the running state.
It does so by filtering the {#SERVICESTATE} macro for the string "Running".

The following macros are available for filtering if desired:

{#SERVICENAME}		The name of the Windows service
{#SERVICEDISPLAY}	The displayname of the Windows service
{#SERVICESTATE}		The state of the Windows service
{#SERVICEDESC}		The Windows service description

All of these can be used to filter by means of regex matching.
